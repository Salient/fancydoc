# fancydoc

LaTeX class for creating overly nice formatted documents. Contains several handy commands for cross-referencing things, likely only useful in business settings.

Currently under development, not yet part of CTAN. Thus, add fancydoc to your document by

`git submodule add <git@github.com>:Salient/fancydoc.git`

followed by

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

wherever your main .tex is located
